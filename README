Building the SDK
----------------

The expanz SDK comes with 3 supported ways of bundling and minification:

1. ASP.NET 4.5 has bundling and minification for release builds built in.  Simply reference each .js file in your site master
   in the order specified in the .bundle files under the build folder, and follow the instructions in Scott Guthrie's blog
   post here: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2011/11/27/new-bundling-and-minification-support-asp-net-4-5-series.aspx

2. If you have the Web Essentials 2012 extension for Visual Studio 2012 installed (http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6)
   then the bundled and minified files in the build folder will automatically update when the source files are changed, or
   if the project is built. The configuration for the bundling/minification can be found in the .bundle files in the build
   folder.

3. Use YUI Compressor for .NET
